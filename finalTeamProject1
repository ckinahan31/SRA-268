In the graph we will be analyzing and visualizing what month it snows the most in State College on average. This is useful knowledge for college students so they can prepare ahead of time for the snow. Along with the initial graph will be three more graphs. These additional three graphs will represent a good way to encode the data, a bad way to encode the data, and a visually unpleasing way to encode the data for the students to view and analyze."

A student looking at the graph can conclude that on average, it snows the most in February in State College. This is easily seen as February shows the tallest bar that corresponds with the average value of just above 4 inches. A student will then know it will be more useful for them to have snow gear around February then it would be in May, where there is no average snowfall. "

The color we used was a bright blue, which draws the eye and is from the cool spectrum of colors. The cool spectrum was used because people easily associate cool colors with the weather, such as the snow. The blue we used was not from the default colormap which helps interest the onlooker. The data is chunked together in a way that makes it easy to analyze and process quickly. Finally, the intervals of 0.1 makes it easy to see what inch level the average snowfall is."

The x axis uses an interval of 2 for the yeras. This isn't effective because it separates the data too much for the student to analyze correctly. The data taken is poorly averaged as it uses the individual averages for each month of each year, instead of just taking the monthly average from all years and putting it together. Finally, the color gray used is not an appealing color to the eye, and is very boring for the onlooker."

For one, the color is from the default colormap, which makes for a bland graph that the onlooker is unimpressed by. Also, because it is an area graph, all of the data is clumped together and difficult to make out in a fast manner. Overall, although the graph is functional, it could still be made more visually appealing by playing with the colors and style so that students could come to a conclusion easier."
